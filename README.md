This repository is for Karmic Staircase (playable on itch.io: https://goldenappler.itch.io/karmic-staircase). 
I make this repository public for the purpose of acting as a reference for my experience as a game developer.
This project demostrates my basic familiarity with the Godot engine, state machines, observer-listener pattern, lighting and particle system.
